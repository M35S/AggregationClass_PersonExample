From the above UML Class Diagram you can see "personalInfo" class uses data types "personType" and "dateType". If the class "personalInfo" were to disappear, classes "personType" and "dateType" could still function independtly. If it were a composition relationship however, should "personalInfo" disappear, "personType" and "dateType" could not function.
